# 🍽️ ResQMeals – AI-Powered Food Rescue Dispatcher

ResQMeals is an agentic AI platform that connects surplus food from restaurants to nearby charities and volunteer drivers in real time. It uses IBM watsonx Orchestrate, AI-powered agents, and cloud-native services to automate food rescue workflows and reduce waste.

## 🌍 Problem

Restaurants and food retailers regularly dispose of large quantities of safe, edible food because redistributing it is slow, manual, and unreliable. Charities and volunteers often lack timely information about available donations, while coordination typically depends on phone calls, spreadsheets, and informal messaging.

This results in:
- Increased food waste
- Higher greenhouse gas emissions
- Missed opportunities to support vulnerable communities

## 💡 Solution

ResQMeals transforms unstructured donation messages into a fully automated dispatch workflow.

A restaurant sends a simple message such as:

> "I have 10 trays of biryani available after 3 PM."

ResQMeals then:

1. Extracts structured donation data using AI
2. Finds eligible nearby charities
3. Ranks candidates based on suitability
4. Assigns an available volunteer driver
5. Drafts a pickup message
6. Generates a digital receipt
7. Logs the full workflow for audit

The entire process completes in seconds.
